Are you a tech seller weary of filling back your merchandise part by part after every sale? Do you think this feels like a job for a robot or a mildly intelligent monkey? 

Well, one of those two will be possible in the near future (depending on if we go with I, Robot or Planet of the Apes), but for now, there's this script. With the click of a button, you can start a process that will buy tech increment by increment, minimizing cost for you and freeing your time to snuggle with your totally-existent girlfriend.

Buys tech amounts of ['4.5', '10', '10', '5', '10', '10', '10', '10', '5', '10', '10', '5.5'] in order, when you click the 'Autobuy' button, until your total tech reaches 100. If you already have some tech (amount < 100), it will try to intelligently fill the gap to the next increment and go from there to 100. 

(If you are new to userscripts, first install **GreaseMonkey** if you're on Firefox, and then click Install here. Chrome users might be able to Install directly - I don't use Chrome, but it's supposed to have inbuilt supposed for this; if it doesn't seem to work, install **TamperMonkey** for Chrome and try again.)
